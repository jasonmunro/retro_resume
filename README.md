Retro game written in pyxel that provides info from my resume

This was a weekend project to learn aobut writing games in Python
using [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel?tab=readme-ov-file)
(which is a very cool project!).

I can make no claims as to the fitness or correctness of the code,
but it was fun to create and works as intended!

You can play the game at [jasonmunro.net](https://jasonmunro.net)
